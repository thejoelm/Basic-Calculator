# Basic-Calculator

I made this personal project to help my understanding of coding logic as well as figuring out how to solve problems concerning calculations as well as number theory in Java.

# How to Use

You can use this project by running the file in any IDE available. THe calculator takes any arithemetic equation, which consists of multiplication (*), division (/), addition (+), and subtraction (-), and can also take exponents as well (^).

After running the file, a prompt will appear that asks for an equation and includes the currently available operation. There is no limit to the length or number of operations available to be used, and decimals and double digits are able to be processed as well. Spaces can be included in the equation if needed, but is not necessary. 
After entering your equation, the result will display in the Console as "Answer: " + The result of the equation. 

Any integer results will be diaplayed without decimals, but answers that do include decimals will display as well as being rounded to the nearest one thousandth. 
The file will automatically perform Order of Operations as well.

# Parentheses Operation

The Parentheses operation is able to be used. To use, please add parentheses around the equation, for example, (3+4). 
You may add in operations around the parentheses, and Order of Operations will still be performed. Example: 2*(2+2) will equal 8, as will (2+2)*2. In addition, parentheses may be used in cooperation with one another. For example, you may do 1+(2*(3+4)), and 15 will be the output. 
However, the operation of (equation)(equation) as well as number(equation) is not supported yet, but can be expected to be added soon.
